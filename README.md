# Word2Vec Product Recommendation System

This project implements a product recommendation system using Word2Vec models. A more detailed/complete version of it was implemented on the website of a wine-seller to recommend users other wines based on the products in their shopping cart. The system consists of two main components:

- `W2VModel.py`: This module is responsible for training and managing Word2Vec models.
- `W2VRecommendation.py`: This module uses the trained Word2Vec models to recommend products to users based on their interactions.

Implemented using Python, MongoDB, and Gensim.
